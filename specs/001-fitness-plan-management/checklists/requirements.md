# Specification Quality Checklist: 健身计划管理

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ All checks passed

**Summary**:
- The specification is complete and well-structured with 4 prioritized user stories
- All 17 functional requirements are clearly defined and testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "用户可以在3分钟内完成...", "提醒通知准时送达率达到98%以上")
- Edge cases are properly identified with suggested solutions
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items are clearly documented
- No implementation details (frameworks, databases, languages) are present in the specification

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Can proceed to `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

No issues found. The specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for implementation planning.
